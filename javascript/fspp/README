fspp.swf is the older version, which doesn't display any watermark.

pan0.swf is the current version of the player, which shows a small watermark in
the lower right corner. this player doesn't mirror the original image anymore,
which makes it more usable. also there is an indicator that it's loading the
image and double clicking on the image goes to full screen.
